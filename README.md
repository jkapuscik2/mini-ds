## Simple React/Redux App to control Digital Signage devices

Features:
- register using Firebase API
- login using Firebase API
- CRUD of owned devices
- CRUD of files
- Assigning files to devices
- API for DS devices (checking for updates and pulling new content)

Idea was to learn and use some Redux

Sample app is available at: [URL](firebase.storage/mini-ds.appspot.com)
